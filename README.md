This repository provides code for the paper on [$k$-Neighbor Based Curriculum Sampling for Sequence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09313.pdf). This method samples nearest neighbors of some tokens in a sequence and replaces them with the ground truth with the aim of reducing compounding errors that occurs because of the i.i.d descrepancy between training time and test time behavior.
