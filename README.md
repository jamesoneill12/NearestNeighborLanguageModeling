# NearestNeighborLanguageModeling
This repository provides code for nearest-neighbor replacement sampling for neural sequence predictors. This method samples nearest neighbors of some tokens in a sequence and replaces them with the ground truth with the aim of reducing compounding errors that occurs because of the i.i.d descrepancy between training time and test time behavior.
